## Findings and Recommendations:

#### Ford : 
Ford had a tagline of "Go further". It is believed to have a dual meaning of being better than competitors and improved fuel economy. Ford has a high life with size but the lift with speed and power is relatively low.
###### Product manager : 
Given the company's emphasis on being better than their competitors, the product managers should certianly need to improve the car interms of  power and speed. With a lift close to 1 ,the product managers becessarily have to work on increasing the speed of the vehicle.
###### Marketing Manager : 
Ford is considered as a affordable car by the company, but the public does not perceive this, evident by low lift values(among other attributes and even amoung other competitors!) and hence the marketing manager has to advertise  the cars as affordable and low price for its features. This may need both the product manager to improve the product and marketing managers to market the product to convey a good deal for the price and compete in the market

#### Honda : 
It had the lagline "The power of dreams" which encourages people to have the conviction to imagine and make dreams a reality which speaks to Honda's innovative nature.
###### Product manager : 
Power and speed have low lift values compared to other attributes. The product managers can focus on improving this, so that people can relate the car to its tagline of "power of dreams".Honda considers it's cars as roomy and hence the product design may need to be changed accordingly and marketed in that fashion too.
###### Marketing manager : 
Honda again considers itself as a affordable brand,its lift value woth price is 1.44, but it is low wrt to other competitors. The marketing team should better advertise honda as having reasonable prices. They can also focus on improving the image of honda interms of quality to compete with toyota.

#### Hyundai : 
"Drive your Way" was designed to communicate the company’s ‘refined and confident’ brand attributes.
###### Product Managers :
Hyundai prides in high quality products but the lift value is very low, something which is alaraming to know that people don’t associate Hyundai much with high quality. The product managers necessarily have to look into quality issues and improve it, if they pride in high quality and pass that important distinction it has from other competitiors to its customers. Power and speed also need to improved, as one needs to be decenlty good in other attributes of the car to compete in the market
###### Marketing managers: 
Hyundai is aagin an affordable brand and it has high lift among its competitors.The marketing managers can focus on improving their brand image with regard to low price to maintain their top position.

#### Mazda : 
Their ad campaign was "Zoom Zoom" to describe driving as a pleasure.
###### Product managers :
For a care to be fun to drive,  quality becomes an important factor.Also the balance between power, speed and quality is crucial. The lift value of quality is close to 1. There needs to be immediate thought on how to improve the quality to compete with others in the market.
###### Marketing Managers: 
They need to work on advertising on quality and work in unison with the product managers.

#### Toyota: 
For toyota it was "Moving forward"  means a passion for innovation and discovery.
###### Product Manager: 
People seem to asssociate toyota with very high quality which is a good news. It has the highest lift value among all its competitors. To help resonate among customers for innovation, the product managers have to work on improving the cars in terms of power and speed.
###### Marketing Managers : 
Toyota has a decent lift value with respect to others interms of price, but the managers can further try to improve the image of the brand as very affordable to its high quality.
